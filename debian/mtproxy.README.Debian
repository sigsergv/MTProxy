Some additional notes before you start.

Program options are set via its main configuration file "/etc/default/mtproxy", feel
free to edit it.

By default mtproxy service is disabled and won't run automatically. Use this command
to enable auto-start:

    systemctl enable mtproxy.service


Also you can use program "/usr/bin/mtproxy-reinit" to update service configuration data,
just run it from root user.
